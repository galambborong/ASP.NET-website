# New website

This project will supercede my current website (see [galambborong/peterkeenan.co.uk](https://github.com/galambborong/peterkeenan.co.uk)). 

## Aims

The aims are to:

* Produce a clean, simple but fully responsive site
* Learn some Bootstrap and CSS Grid
* Gain some experience with ASP.NET and Razor
* Learn some SQL and employ a database

## Notes

The big 'unknown' at this stage is what form the blog will take. I'm exploring possible blog engines within the ASP.NET ecosystem, but also toying with the possiblity of creating my own modest template for this. The main thing is that it should be consistent with the 'theme' of the main site, rather than an awkward addon.
