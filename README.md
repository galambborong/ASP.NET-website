# Abandoned

I started this project before learning that I had to build a portfolio website in pure HTML, CSS and JS (ie, no framework) as part of my precourse for a coding bootcamp. The function and content of the two sites was pretty much identical, so I've decided to abandon this project. 

I'm leaving the repository in place both as I intend to do more ASP.NET and will likely want to refer to this and because I may end up finishing it at some point.

## Aims

The aims were to:

* Produce a clean, simple but fully responsive site
* Learn some Bootstrap and CSS Grid
* Gain some experience with ASP.NET and Razor
* Learn some SQL and deploy a database
