      I'm a longstanding GNU/Linux user, with an inclination towards Arch-based distributions.
      I also prefer to use a tiling window manager rather than more typical desktop environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, I am running ArcoLinux with XMonad on my main desktop computer and  
      standard Arch with suckless' dwm on my laptop. I have also run Manjaro (with both XMonad, dwm and 
      &ndash; briefly &ndash; XFCE). <emp>(Disclaimer! I use Ubuntu on my server!)</emp>
    </p>
    <h3>Why Arch-based distros?</h3>
    <p>
      Once you start running tiling window managers and using primarily CLI-based tools, 
      the truth is that the differences between distributions are not as pronounced as 
      hardcore distro fans would have you believe. For me, it boils down to two things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ease of access to maintained packages</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All Arch-based distributions come with the <code>pacman</code> package manager and the 
      AUR (Arch Users' Repository). Between these, we're pretty well covered both in terms of 
      access to programs and their being kept up-to-date with the upstream repos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anybody who's taken a serious dive into using Linux will likely have used the ArchWiki. 
      It's an absolutely brilliant resource whether you use an Arch-based distro or not,  
      but it's even more valuable if you do. Pretty much anything you need to look up is 
      well documented there. 
    </p>
    <h3>My prefered tools</h3>
    <p>
      I like the low-overheads of dwm, but after using both dwm and XMonad for a while
      I most definitely am an XMonad guy. That said, I really rate suckless' 'products' 
      (for want of a better word) so use their terminal emulator <b>st</b>, which I've configured to 
      my liking over time, and <b>dmenu</b>. I'm currently using <b>zsh</b> as my shell, 
      though am thinking of just adopting <b>fish</b>. (Naturally bash will always be on my system.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a big fan of Vim-inspired programs and like to use the Vim bindings where possible. 
      I now use Neovim, rather than vanilla Vim, for extensibility reasons. I'm quite a prolific 
      user of VimWiki as my notetaking application. I also have (and use) VSCodium &ndash; 
      the <i>actual</i> free and open source version of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Betwen the disto, window manager, terminal emulator and text editor - that covers the 
      'biggies' of my Linux setup. Beyond these, I opt for free and open source software where 
      possible, though I am not fully free from the shackles of proprietary software yet.
