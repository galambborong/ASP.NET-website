    <h2 class="display-6">Performance</h1>
        <p>I've never formally trained as a conductor but instead try to take/make every opportunity to broaden my
            experience. I have also benefitted greatly from sitting down with people I respect and chatting over a
            score.</p>
        <p>I have done a fair variety of genres and styles, but seem to find my voice mainly in eighteenth-century
            repertoire. I've collated most of my conducted repertoire into a list here.</p>
        <h3>Opera dei Lumi</h3>
        <p>I founded <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://operadeilumi.org.uk">Opera dei Lumi</a>
            in 2014. We did two concert performances of Mozart operas (<i>Cos&igrave; fan tutte</i> and <i>Le nozze di
                Figaro</i>) and did a one-off performance of Mozart's Requiem in 2016. Realising that for this to really
            go somewhere (and not just be one-off things that were fun), I began building the organisation from the
            ground up in 2017. It is now a registered charity with a board of trustees, a clear business plan and
            &ndash; most importantly &ndash; an ever growing audience.</p>
        <h3>Northern Praeclassica</h3>
        <p>In January 2020 I took over as Music Director of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://northernpraeclassica.weebly.com/index.html">Northern Praeclassica</a>, an a capella
            community choir in Newcastle. I've worked with them for about a term, but due to covid-19 we've not yet
            performed together. (We would have done two concerts by now!) I'm looking forward to getting back to it.</p>
