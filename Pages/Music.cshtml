    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>
        I've never formally trained as a conductor but instead try to take/make every opportunity to broaden my
        experience. I have also benefitted greatly from sitting down with people I respect and chatting over a
        score.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have done a fair variety of genres and styles, but seem to find my voice mainly in eighteenth-century
        repertoire. I've collated most of my conducted repertoire into a list here.
    </p>
    <h3>Opera dei Lumi</h3>
    <p>
        I founded <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://operadeilumi.org.uk">Opera dei Lumi</a>
        in 2014. We did two concert performances of Mozart operas (<i>Cos&igrave; fan tutte</i> and
        <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>) and did a one-off performance of Mozart's Requiem in 2016. Realising that for this to really
        go somewhere (and not just be one-off things that were fun), I began building the organisation from the
        ground up in 2017. It is now a registered charity with a board of trustees, a clear business plan and
        &ndash; most importantly &ndash; an ever growing audience.
    </p>
    <h3>Northern Praeclassica</h3>
    <p>
        In January 2020 I took over as Music Director of
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
           href="https://northernpraeclassica.weebly.com/index.html">
            Northern Praeclassica
        </a>, an a capella
        community choir in Newcastle. I've worked with them for about a term, but due to covid-19 we've not yet
        performed together. (We would have done two concerts by now!) I'm looking forward to getting back to it.
